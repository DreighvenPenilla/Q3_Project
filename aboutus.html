					Welcome to the official website of the Philippines' Fire Department. We are officially responsible with preventing fires and protecting citizens from the dangers these fires impose. We are also responsible for the enforcement of the Fire Code and other laws concerning fires in the country.<br><br>

					The FDP was formed after Republic Act 6975, or the Department of Interior and local Government Act of 1990, was issued in December 1991. A month after that, the FDP was officially formed with members consisting of the Fire Service of the Integrated National Police.<br><br>

					The history of the FDP goes a long way, back to August 7, 1901 when the Manila Fire Department was formed. The officials of the fire department at the time were Americans, as the Philippines was then colonized by the United States of America. It was only in 1935 when the first Filipino Fire Chief of the Manila Fire Department was appoined-- Deputy Chief Jacinto Lorenzo.<br><br>

					As the years go by, many more fire departments were established nationally and also acts supporting the FDP, such as the R.A. 9263 (BFP Professionaliation Act of 2004) and R.A. 9592 (Act extending the 5 years reglementary period for complying the minimum education qualification and appropriation eligibility in the appointment of the FDP) signed by former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.<br><br>

					If you wish to visit our headquarters, please head to Agham Road, Quezon City where our official national headquarters resides.<br><br>
