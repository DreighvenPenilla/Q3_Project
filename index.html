This is a time where various individuals are reminded to be aware of numerous fire-causing hazards that could be found in their homes. Additionally, March is said to be one of the warmest months for our country, not only because of the fact it's the start of summer, but also because March is also the month wherein there tends to be various reported cases of fires happening in the country.</td>

Fire does not only hurt us when we come into close contact with it, but it also causes dangers with the smoke we inhale. This smoke contains harmful chemicals which may lead to infections or diseases in the circulatory and respiratory system.</td>
